- ~~document all the csrs~~
- figure out how to send code to the ipu card
- figure out how sending between tiles works
- figure out debugging on the ipu card
- try compiling with the graphcore toolchain 
- write test programs that link against the core libraries, and disassemble them to figure out how stuff like communication actually works

future fun stuff:
- extend llvm to support the spooky secret instructions (sync, send, sans)
- reverse engineer the icu!
